# ML-for-Diabetes

Diabetes is an illness caused because of high glucose level in a human body. Diabetes should not be ignored if it is untreated then Diabetes may cause some major issues in a person like: heart related problems, kidney problem, blood pressure, eye damage and it can also affect other organs of human body.  Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted earlier

To get predicted we can use various machine learning techniques.  Machine learning techniques Provide better result for prediction by constructing models from datasets collected from patients. In this work we will use Machine Learning Classification and ensemble techniques on a dataset to predict diabetes.

Our Result shows that Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to other machine learning techniques.
